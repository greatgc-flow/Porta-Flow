## §0. How to Read This Document

This document defines the **governance layer** of AI-assisted software development — the meta-system ensuring AI agents and humans collaborate reliably, symmetrically, and adaptably.

**What this document IS**: A measurement framework + taxonomy for governing HOW AI agents collaborate.
**What this document is NOT**: A guide to what AI agents should build (application layer).

**Three reading modes:**
- **Universal** (§0–§10 only): Applicable to any AI system, any vendor combination.
- **Implementation** (+ Appendix A): Reference implementation details (Windows Sandbox).
- **Multi-vendor** (+ Appendix B): Template for cross-vendor deployment.

**How to use completeness scores**: Two scores are tracked (see §7 for formulas):
- **Framework Score** = % of items with defined governance rules (T1 or above). v9 = ~100%.
- **Implementation Score** = min(Current Tier / Target Tier, 1.0) for each item. v9 = ~37.6%.
A score of 0.00 means "not yet implemented". T0 = undefined, T4 = fully automated with active alerts.

**Category ID vs. Phase Label**: Category IDs (Cat 0, Cat 1, ...) are the permanent reference identifiers used throughout this document and in all external references. Phase labels (Phase 1 through Phase 7) describe the **chronological lifecycle order** and are used in §2 and diagrams for readability. Both refer to the same categories.

| Phase Label | Category ID | Name | Weight |
|:------------|:------------|:-----|:------:|
| Phase 1 | Cat 0 | Human Intent & Kickoff | 8% |
| Phase 2 | Cat 4 | Environment Portability | 13% |
| Phase 3 | Cat 1 | Cognitive Continuity | 17% |
| Phase 4 | Cat 2 | Collaboration Governance | 22% |
| Phase 5 | Cat 3 | System Integrity | 28% |
| Phase 6 | Cat 5 | Operations & Control | 7% |
| Phase 7 | Cat 6 | Product Delivery & Validation | 5% |

## §1. Scope & Universal Principles

### §1.1 Scope

**In scope**: Working memory lifecycle · multi-agent consensus · symmetric participation ·
collaborative task planning · role management · vendor abstraction · environment portability ·
observability · functional verification · external invocation governance · human intent capture ·
flexible participation (join/leave/monitor) · compute governance · learning loops ·
runtime reconfigurability · artifact scale governance · governance debt tracking ·
quality attribute measurement (flexibility · scalability · maintainability) ·
meta-governance (framework self-upgrade) · human authority transfer · delivery failure handling.

**Out of scope**: Application business logic, domain models, UI/UX, deployment pipelines,
bare-metal infrastructure scaling (hardware, container orchestration, RAM allocation).

### §1.2 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **AI Node** | Any AI agent in the system (language model, coding assistant, etc.) |
| **Human** | The operator who may vote in consensus, defines intent, and accepts deliverables |
| **Node Instance** | A specific running process of a model; one model may back multiple instances |
| **Role** | A virtual function assigned to a node instance at runtime (e.g., Architect, Reviewer) |
| **Session** | A bounded unit of work: start → execution → delivery. Used as the base unit for all session-scoped measurements (e.g., overhead ratio in 5-11, retry count in 6-4). |
| **Directive** | A formally structured task assignment targeting a Role (not a node ID) |
| **Consensus** | A formally recorded agreement among all ACTIVE nodes on a decision |
| **Working Memory** | The active payload available to an AI node during a session |
| **Handoff** | Structured artifact carrying session state to the next session or node |
| **Compute Budget** | Total allowed resource consumption (normalized units or currency) per period |
| **Reference Token** | A vendor-agnostic unit for measuring compute; defined at system initialization |
| **Participation Mode** | Node's engagement state: ACTIVE / OBSERVER[SILENT\|ANNOTATING] / GRACEFUL_EXIT / FORCED_EXIT |
| **Task Force** | A voted sub-group operating with scoped consensus on a shared sub-goal |
| **Vendor Adapter** | Software component translating a vendor's native API to the canonical protocol |
| **Vendor Execution Layer** | The unmanaged black-box zone where AI inference occurs; governance validates BEFORE (Cat 2) and AFTER (Cat 3), not inside |
| **MECE** | Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive — no overlap, no gaps |
| **Kaizen** | Continuous Process Remediation — iterative improvement by identifying and fixing the root causes of failures. Originated in manufacturing (Japanese: 改善 = "change for better"); universally applicable to any system that must learn from failures. |
| **5-Why** | Root cause analysis technique: ask "Why?" five times in succession to reach the fundamental cause of a failure. Example: "Why did the test fail?" → "Why was the dependency wrong?" → ... until root cause is found. |
| **Primary Success Scenario** | The primary designed use case of a deliverable, verified end-to-end (also called "golden path" in engineering) |
| **VCS** | Version Control System — any system tracking changes to artifacts over time (e.g., Git, SVN) |
| **Governance Debt** | Cumulative cost of deferred or bypassed governance. GD Score = (active_bypass_count × 5) + (stale_pm_count × 3) + (floor(degraded_hours/24) × 2). Unit: GD points. Ceiling: `governance_debt_ceiling`. |
| **Quality Attribute** | A cross-cutting non-functional property describing HOW the governance system behaves: Flexibility, Scalability, or Maintainability. Distinct from functional governance categories. |
| **Hot-reload** | Updating a governance parameter mid-session without stopping and restarting nodes. Requires `hot_reload_enabled=1` and satisfies state-consistency pre-conditions (5-10). |
| **Artifact Scale** | Total count of managed artifacts (files, modules, schemas) in a session's scope. When count exceeds `artifact_scale_threshold`, governance applies localized scope rather than full-repository scope. |
| **Configuration Drift** | State where a parameter's default value differs between its source-code definition and its external config-file definition. Detected and blocked by 3-14. |
| **Meta-Governance** | The process of applying governance to the governance framework itself — how the taxonomy, parameters, and rules are officially modified, versioned, and deployed. Defined in 3-15. |
| **Framework Score** | % of items at T1 or above (governance rule is at least documented). Measures framework definition completeness. See §7. |
| **Implementation Score** | Weighted average of min(Current Tier / Target Tier, 1.0) for all items. Measures how much of the framework is actually deployed. See §7. |
| **Canonical Peer Interface** | The minimum interface contract that any AI peer must satisfy to participate in governance (4-13). Separates the common interface layer from vendor-specific adapter translation (4-9). |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | A standardized protocol for connecting AI models to tools, data sources, and services. Governed as an extension type under 4-14-3. |
| **Agent Framework** | An execution wrapper that orchestrates multi-step AI behavior (e.g., AutoGen, CrewAI, LangChain). Must be sandboxed per 4-14-1 before joining sessions. |
| **Skill** | A discrete, versioned, callable capability registered per 4-14-2. Distinguished from a full Agent by its single-function scope. |
| **Lazy Initialization** | Deferring resource instantiation until the resource is first explicitly requested by a directive (5-12). Reduces bootstrap cost; pairs with idle teardown. |
| **MTC (Mean Time to Consensus)** | The elapsed time from a PROPOSE event to a FINALIZED event in the consensus cycle (2-2). Used in T3 and T11 balance metrics. |
| **UAT (User Acceptance Test)** | A test performed by the Human to verify that delivered artifacts satisfy the acceptance criteria defined in Cat 0-2. Governs Cat 6-2 delivery closure. |
| **PM (Post-Mortem)** | A structured incident review document generated after a P0/P1 event. Required by Cat 3-8. Contains Root Cause (5-Why), Timeline, Category, Prevention, and Policy Revision fields. |

### §1.3 Measurement Tiers

#### Type B — Binary / Structural (existence is the metric)

| Tier | Criterion | Score |
|:----:|:----------|:-----:|
| T0 | Not defined | 0% |
| T1 | Draft/policy exists | 50% |
| **T2** | **Enforced by automated check or system constraint** | **100%** |

#### Type C — Continuous / Operational (ongoing monitoring meaningful)

| Tier | Criterion | Score |
|:----:|:----------|:-----:|
| T0 | Not defined | 0% |
| T1 | Threshold/definition documented | 25% |
| T2 | Implementation exists; manual check possible | 50% |
| T3 | Automated check/script exists | 75% |
| **T4** | **Active monitoring + auto-alert on threshold breach** | **100%** |

> **Implementation Score formula**: `min(Current Tier / Target Tier, 1.0)`
> If current > target (over-engineered): score = 1.00 (capped)

#### Measurement Failure Response

| Collaboration Depth | Tier 3/4 failure action |
|:-------------------:|:------------------------|
| Maximum (e.g., Depth 10) | **HALT + ESCALATE** to human gate |
| Medium (e.g., Depth 5–8) | **WARN + continue** — log to metrics store |
| Minimal (e.g., Depth 0–3) | **LOG only** — no interruption |

### §1.4 Abstraction Principle

Universal parameter names are used in §0–§10. Implementers map these to their specific systems.
- See Appendix A.2 for reference parameter mapping.
- See Appendix B for multi-vendor setup template.

**Selective Deployment**: Items in this taxonomy may be deployed incrementally. The Implementation Score (§7) tracks which items are active. An item at T0 is "defined but not deployed" — it does not block other items from functioning. Teams may choose to deploy only the categories and items relevant to their governance maturity level. Core infrastructure items (4-2-5 eager core) are prerequisites; all others are independently deployable.

### §1.5 Quality Attributes Overlay

Three cross-cutting quality attributes are formally tracked. They describe **HOW** the governance system performs, not WHAT it governs. They are embedded in existing lifecycle categories rather than forming standalone categories, preserving the closed-loop structure.

#### Attribute Definitions

| Attribute | Symbol | Definition |
|:----------|:------:|:-----------|
| **Flexibility** | [FLEX] | Ability to adapt governance behavior without breaking correctness. Examples: adding a new AI vendor; changing parameters mid-session; hot-reloading config without restart; swapping vendor instances during execution. |
| **Scalability** | [SCALE] | Ability to maintain governance quality as the system grows in any of four dimensions: (a) horizontal — more nodes; (b) vertical — more complex tasks; (c) temporal — longer sessions; (d) artifact scale — larger repositories. |
| **Maintainability** | [MAINT] | Ability to evolve the governance system sustainably. Examples: detecting configuration drift; measuring governance debt; keeping governance documents current; tracking improvement velocity. |

#### Coverage Map

| Attribute | Taxonomy Items | Coverage |
|:----------|:---------------|:---------|
| FLEX | 0-5, 2-6, 2-8, 2-8-5, 4-3, 4-9, 4-13, 4-14, 5-2, 5-8, 5-10, T22 | 100% |
| SCALE | 2-7, 4-10, 4-14, 5-6, 5-7, 5-11, 5-12, T11 | 100% |
| MAINT | 1-4, 3-2-6, 3-3, 3-8, 3-13, 3-14, 3-15, 4-4, 4-11, 5-9 | 100% |

#### Quality Attribute Closed-Loop (Full 7-Phase Path)

All quality attribute constraints declared in 0-5 flow through **every phase** of the lifecycle:

```
[Human] Phase 1 (Cat 0): 0-5 declares F/S/M constraints
  → Phase 2 (Cat 4): Environment provisioned respecting constraints (4-10, 4-11, 4-12)
  → Phase 3 (Cat 1): Memory lifecycle respects scale limits (1-1)
  → Phase 4 (Cat 2): Collaboration governed with flexibility (2-6, 2-8, 5-10)
  → Phase 5 (Cat 3): Integrity enforces and measures compliance (3-13, 3-14, 3-15)
  → Phase 6 (Cat 5): Operations enforces overhead limits (5-10, 5-11)
  → Phase 7 (Cat 6): Delivery validated; F/S/M lessons captured (6-3-2)
  → Phase 1 (Cat 0): Refine constraints for next session  [↩ closed loop]
```

---

## §2. Human-in-Loop Lifecycle

The 7 governance categories (Phase 1–7) form a **closed feedback cycle**. All participants (any AI, any vendor, the Human) may engage symmetrically in any phase (see Cat 2-1).

AI-Assisted Development: Governance Framework
│
├─ Cat 0 / Phase 1: Human Intent & Kickoff  [8%]
│  Entry gate. Every cycle starts here — including a health pre-check (0-6) before intent
│  capture. ANY capable node may facilitate this phase. Output: structured intent schema.
│
│  ├── 0-1: Structured Intent Capture  [B|T2]
│  │   Every task MUST begin with a structured artifact containing Goal ID, Scope boundary,
│  │   and Constraints BEFORE any multi-node execution begins.
│  │   Example: "build login feature" → Goal ID: LOGIN-001, Scope: auth module only,
│  │   Constraints: no third-party auth libs, target: HTTP 200/401 responses.
│  │   ├── 0-1-1: Goal statement — one sentence, unique Goal ID assigned
│  │   ├── 0-1-2: Scope bounding — explicit MVP boundary vs. deferred scope
│  │   └── 0-1-3: Constraint identification — time, tech, budget, non-goals
│  │
│  ├── 0-2: Success Criteria Definition  [B|T2]
│  │   Human-verifiable acceptance criteria MUST exist before execution.
│  │   Example: "Login: HTTP 200 with valid credentials; HTTP 401 with invalid."
│  │   ├── 0-2-1: Acceptance criteria — ≥1 human-checkable condition per Goal ID
│  │   ├── 0-2-2: Quality thresholds — measurable bars (test coverage %, latency ms, etc.)
│  │   └── 0-2-3: Delivery format — file path, output schema, or artifact type
│  │
│  ├── 0-3: Clarification Protocol  [C|T3]
│  │   AI agents MUST surface ambiguities within `clarification_max_turns` rounds.
│  │   ├── 0-3-1: Ambiguity detection — ≥1 unclear requirement → ask human
│  │   ├── 0-3-2: Turn limit — max `clarification_max_turns` rounds (default: 3)
│  │   └── 0-3-3: Intent confirmation — explicit human ACK recorded before multi-file execution
│  │
│  ├── 0-4: Continuous Intent Alignment  [B|T2]
│  │   All file modifications MUST occur within the declared scope. Out-of-scope = blocked.
│  │   ├── 0-4-1: Scope enforcement — every file mutation checked against allowed scope
│  │   ├── 0-4-2: Drift detection — out-of-scope action → flag before execution
│  │   └── 0-4-3: Scope escalation — drift above threshold → human gate
│  │
│  ├── 0-5: Non-Functional Intent Capture  [B|T2]  [FLEX] [SCALE] [MAINT]
│  │   Human MUST declare quality attribute constraints before infrastructure is provisioned.
│  │   These constraints scope all subsequent governance decisions across all 7 phases.
│  │   Human-first entry point for the Quality Attribute closed-loop cycle (§1.5).
│  │   Example: "Must support 5,000+ files" (SCALE), "Hot-reload permitted" (FLEX),
│  │   "Doc review every 30 days" (MAINT).
│  │   ├── 0-5-1: Scalability constraints — max artifact count, max node count, session duration
│  │   ├── 0-5-2: Flexibility constraints — hot-reload permitted (Y/N), vendor swap (Y/N)
│  │   └── 0-5-3: Maintainability constraints — doc freshness interval, governance debt ceiling
│  │
│  └── 0-6: Governance Health Pre-Check  [C|T3]
│      BEFORE capturing new intent, the system MUST verify it is in a healthy enough state
│      to begin a new session. This prevents building new work on top of unresolved failures
│      or an improperly closed previous session.
│      Example: Previous session left 2 unresolved P0 alerts → pre-check blocks new session
│      start until human acknowledges and resolves alerts.
│      ├── 0-6-1: GD Score gate — GD Score (from 3-13) < `governance_debt_ceiling`
│      ├── 0-6-2: Critical alert clearance — no active P0 alerts from previous session
│      └── 0-6-3: Session closure confirmation — previous session properly archived (6-3-1 done)
│
├─ Cat 4 / Phase 2: Environment Portability  [13%]
│  Infrastructure and vendor integration. MUST be verified before cognitive work (Cat 1).
│  Output: environment manifest (adapters ready, node profiles loaded, audit storage confirmed).
│  Failure: bootstrap fail → Human Gate → fix environment → retry.
│
│  ├── 4-1: Runtime Environment  [C|T3]
│  │   All runtime dependencies MUST be self-contained; no host system state assumed.
│  │   Example: all runtime packages in an isolated virtual environment; no host installs.
│  │   ├── 4-1-1: Runtime isolation — language runtime and deps isolated from host
│  │   ├── 4-1-2: Encoding consistency — character encoding explicitly set system-wide
│  │   ├── 4-1-3: Package manager isolation — package installs scoped to project
│  │   ├── 4-1-4: Environment variable scoping — per-agent env vars isolated
│  │   └── 4-1-5: Runtime security profile — execution meets minimum security baseline
│  │               (e.g., no unrestricted script execution; policy defined per platform)
│  │
│  ├── 4-2: Installation & Deployment  [C|T3]
│  │   A single bootstrap entry point MUST reconstruct the full environment from scratch.
│  │   Example: running the bootstrap command on a clean OS installs all dependencies
│  │   and passes smoke tests with zero manual steps.
│  │   ├── 4-2-1: Zero-base bootstrap — one entry point = full reconstruction, 0 manual steps
│  │   ├── 4-2-2: Dependency bootstrapping — all tools and packages auto-installed
│  │   ├── 4-2-3: Smoke testing — post-install validation confirms environment health
│  │   ├── 4-2-4: Parallel-safe naming — no filename collisions in concurrent setups
│  │   └── 4-2-5: Eager Core, Lazy Periphery — bootstrap MUST eagerly initialize ONLY core
│  │               governance infrastructure: parameter registry (5-1), event broker (4-3),
│  │               and basic policy check engine (3-2). All vendor connections, agent frameworks,
│  │               MCP servers, and capability extensions MUST be verified for availability
│  │               (health-check only) but remain dormant until explicitly invoked by a directive.
│  │               This item co-governs with 5-12 (Resource Lazy Initialization):
│  │               4-2-5 defines WHAT belongs in the eager core; 5-12 governs the lazy periphery.
│  │               PASS: bootstrap exits with only core infra active; no vendor connections open.
│  │               FAIL: vendor client or agent framework initialized during bootstrap without an
│  │               active directive.
│  │
│  ├── 4-3: Infrastructure Abstraction  [C|T3]  [FLEX] [SCALE]
│  │   IPC, messaging, and shared state MUST be decoupled from node identity.
│  │   Example: replacing the IPC backend requires no changes to individual node code.
│  │   ├── 4-3-1: Technology-neutral IPC — message broker decouples nodes from transport
│  │   ├── 4-3-2: Shared state layer — node-independent state accessible to all agents

│
│  └── 5-12: Resource Lazy Initialization  [C|T3]  [SCALE]
│      Heavy resources (vendor API connections, Agent frameworks, MCP servers, specialized node
│      instances) MUST be initialized upon first explicit directive use, NOT at system bootstrap.
│      This prevents resource waste during idle phases and supports lightweight startup.
│      Boundary note: 4-2 (bootstrap) defines WHAT is required at startup (core governance infra);
│      5-12 defines WHEN heavy optional resources are instantiated (lazy, on demand).
│      Example: a vendor AI client connection deferred until first directive requiring it; not initialized at orchestrator startup.
│      ├── 5-12-1: Just-In-Time Allocation — heavy/vendor resources MUST be deferred until the
│      │           first directive explicitly requires them; system bootstrap allocates only core

│      ├── 5-12-2: Idle Teardown — initialized resources unused for > `idle_teardown_timeout`
│      │           minutes MUST be deallocated; prevents resource leak during long-running sessions;

│      └── 5-12-3: Event-Driven Check Execution — governance checks (e.g., GD Score computation

│                  MUST execute on-demand, triggered by relevant lifecycle events or explicit
│                  boundary transitions — NOT by continuous idle polling loops.
│                  Example: GD Score recalculates on bypass event or session end, not every second.
│                  This extends 5-12's lazy principle from resources to governance checks.
│                  PASS: check execution traces are event-triggered (audit log shows trigger event
│                  immediately preceding check run); no periodic polling loops in governance scripts.

   └── 6-5: Partial Acceptance Protocol  [C|T3]
       When a delivery partially satisfies acceptance criteria, a defined protocol allows
       partial acceptance rather than binary pass/fail, enabling iterative delivery.

| T12 | Pruning aggressiveness | Memory preservation | `resolved_item_ttl` | Shorter = more aggressive |
| T13 | Metric granularity | Storage I/O | `metrics_persist_interval` | Shorter = more data |
| T14 | Forecast sensitivity | Alert fatigue | `forecast_alert_threshold` | Lower = more alerts |

| T16 | Active automation | Human control | `active_control_enabled` | 0=safe default |
| T17 | Compute economy | Collaboration depth | `daily_compute_budget` + `collaboration_depth` | Dual control |
| T18 | Full rewrite (safe syntax, high cost) | Surgical patch (low cost, syntax risk) | Edit strategy policy | Practice-based |
| T19 | Human visual verification (blocks async) | Automated testing (compute cost) | Test strategy policy | Policy-based |
| T20 | Heuristic flexibility | Strict policy gates | `policy_bypass_floor` | Higher = more gates bypassed |
| T21 | System specificity (high precision) | Universal portability | Audience declaration | Architecture choice |
| T22 | Vendor-native capability | Canonical abstraction (portability) | `allowed_vendors` + 4-9 adapter cost | Proprietary optimizations vs. multi-vendor governance |

### Balance Metrics for Key Trade-offs

**T3 — Consensus Accuracy vs. Latency**

| Metric | Measurement | Balance Criterion |
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------------|
| MTC (Mean Time to Consensus) | Propose→FINALIZED event time delta | MTC ≤ `consensus_timeout` × 0.5 |
| Rejection Rate | ESCALATE count / total rounds | ≤ 10% |

**T11 — Node Scalability vs. Consensus Complexity**

| Metric | Measurement | Balance Criterion |
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------------|
| MTC Decay Rate | Δ MTC per additional ACTIVE node | Linear growth = acceptable; exponential = scalability failing |
| Quorum Cap | Active quorum vs. `max_nodes_per_consensus` | Quorum ≤ cap at all times |

**T17 — Compute Economy vs. Depth**

| Metric | Measurement | Balance Criterion |
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------------|
| Budget Utilization | Daily spend / `daily_compute_budget` × 100 | < `budget_alert_threshold` |
| Rounds per Decision | Avg rounds per FINALIZED directive | ≤ 3 |

**T27 — Governance Completeness vs. Execution Velocity**

| Metric | Measurement | Balance Criterion |
|:-------|:-----------|:-----------------|
| Overhead Ratio | Governance compute / total compute | ≤ `governance_overhead_ceiling_pct` |
| Consecutive Violations | Sessions with ratio > ceiling | < 3 consecutive sessions |

## §5.5 Logical Contradictions (C1–C10)

> Non-parameterizable tensions requiring explicit acknowledgment and management strategy.
> Tensions that are parameterizable (tunable via §6 parameters) are classified as Trade-offs
> in §5 rather than as Logical Contradictions here. See T28 (hot-reload vs. audit) and T31
> (tool/skill autonomy vs. governance) for examples of tensions resolved by parameterization.

| # | Contradiction | Affected | Management Strategy |
|:--|:-------------|:---------|:-------------------|
| C1 | Depth verbosity vs. working memory size: maximum depth mandates unlimited rounds, guaranteeing memory growth beyond warn threshold | Cat 1-1 vs 2-2, 2-5 | `collaboration_depth` acts as relief valve. Reduce for extended sessions. Ceiling enforced by `context_critical_threshold`. |
| C2 | "Zero-context usable" claim vs. historical observability: Cat 5-6 (ROI) and Cat 5-9 (velocity) require historical data unavailable at session start | §1.1 vs 5-6, 5-9 | "Zero-context" = document self-explanatory, not system history-free. Runtime analytics require history. Framework Score (100%) is zero-context; Implementation Score is not. |
| C3 | Active control loop vs. Human-in-Loop gates: automated circuit-breaker may change depth and trigger checkpoints — potentially overriding Cat 0/6 human gates | Cat 5-5 vs 0, 6 | `active_control_enabled=0` default. When enabled, loop MUST NOT override Cat 0 intent gate or Cat 6 delivery ACK. Human bookends explicitly exempt. |
| C4 | Audit log completeness vs. memory pruning: immutable logging (3-9) keeps everything; aggressive pruning (1-1-3, 1-3-2) discards data | Cat 3-9 vs 1-1-3, 1-3-2 | Audit log stored in dedicated infrastructure (4-12), outside working memory buffer. Pruning applies only to working memory. Audit log is NEVER subject to memory pruning operations. |
| C5 | Degraded mode autonomy vs. human intent timeout: degraded mode (5-8) requires human intervention, but `intent_timeout` risks premature abort before human can respond | Cat 5-8 vs 0-3 | Degraded mode SUSPENDS `intent_timeout` indefinitely (not merely extends it). Session auto-suspends and resumes when human responds. Auto-resume triggered by human response event. Normal timeout resumes only after full recovery. |
| C6 | Concurrent velocity vs. state lock rigor: strict locking (5-7) ensures consistency but serializes operations | Cat 5-7 | Fine-grained optimistic locking (file-level, not workspace-wide). Escalate only on actual conflict, not pre-emptively. |
| C7 | Vendor transparency vs. security isolation: adapters (4-9) are open-auditable; credentials (3-1-2) are isolated | Cat 4-9 vs 3-1 | Orthogonal concerns. Adapter code = auditable process logic. Credentials = runtime secrets. No conflict in practice. |
| C8 | Unanimity at max depth vs. vendor response latency: full consensus requires all nodes, but vendors respond at different speeds | Cat 2-2-2 vs 4-9 | `consensus_timeout` sets ceiling. Unanimity waits up to timeout then escalates regardless of vendor speed. |
| C9 | Instance multiplicity vs. decision attribution: 2-9 requires ROLE attribution; 3-9 requires INSTANCE_ID for compliance | Cat 2-9-3 vs 3-9 | 2-9 uses ROLE_ID (governance). 3-9 uses INSTANCE_ID (compliance). Immutable join table (2-9-5) bridges both simultaneously. |
| C10 | Sub-team scalability vs. global working memory: concurrent sub-team synthesis can instantly saturate global working memory threshold (1-1) | Cat 2-7 vs 1-1 | Memory compaction (1-3-2) invoked dynamically during sub-team synthesis before merged output enters global working memory. Sub-team output bounded by remaining memory budget. |

## §7. Governance Maturity Scoring Model

### Dual Scoring System

Two distinct scores measure different aspects of maturity:

```
FRAMEWORK SCORE (Definition Completeness):
  = items at T1 or above / total items × 100%
  Answers: "Are all governance rules written down?"
  v10 = ~100% (all 67 items have defined governance rules in §3)

IMPLEMENTATION SCORE (Deployment Completeness):
  Item Score     = min(Current Tier / Target Tier, 1.0)
  Category Score = arithmetic mean of all Item Scores in that category
  Root Score     = Σ (Category Weight × Category Score)
  Answers: "Has each rule been deployed/automated in the reference system?"
  v10 = ~36.3% (4 new T0 items + many existing items pending G-series implementation)
```

> **Why dual scoring?** Expanding the framework with new items temporarily lowers the
> Implementation Score because new items start at T0. The dual score prevents this from being
> misread as regression. Framework Score = signal for governance definition completeness;
> Implementation Score = signal for deployment readiness.

### Category Weights

```
Cat 0 (Intent):         8%   — human entry point; lightweight but loop-opening
Cat 1 (Memory):        17%   — agent reasoning foundation
Cat 2 (Collaboration): 22%   — governance backbone
Cat 3 (Integrity):     28%   — survival condition; failure blocks all execution
Cat 4 (Environment):   13%   — infrastructure prerequisite
Cat 5 (Operations):     7%   — non-blocking ops; inefficiency if weak
Cat 6 (Delivery):       5%   — loop closer; downstream
Total:                100%
```

> Category weights are kept constant across v3–v9 to preserve historical Root Score comparability.

### Item Counts by Category (v10)

```
Cat 0:  6 items  (sub-items 0-x-x not counted as top-level)
Cat 1:  5 items  (sub-item 1-2-6 not counted as top-level)
Cat 2:  9 items  (sub-item 2-6-4 not counted as top-level)
Cat 3: 15 items  (sub-items 3-2-6, 3-5-4 not counted as top-level)
Cat 4: 15 items  (sub-items 4-5-4, 4-7-6, 4-9-5, 4-11-4, 4-13-4 not counted as top-level)
Cat 5: 12 items  (sub-items 5-1-4, 5-4-5, 5-12-3 not counted as top-level)
Cat 6:  5 items
Total: 67 items
```

### Root Score "Done" Gate (6 conditions, all simultaneous)

| # | Condition | How to Verify |
|:--|:---------|:--------------|
| ① | Static policy gate exits 0 | Run automated N-check suite; verify exit code = 0 |
| ② | Health monitor: normal band | Health endpoint returns normal band |
| ③ | Root Score ≥ 0.95 | Apply §7 Implementation Score formula with current tier values |
| ④ | All Tier 3/4 KPIs at PASS | §4 Matrix: all items at PASS condition |
| ⑤ | All gaps resolved (§8; G11 deferred acceptable) | §8 Gap Log: all items ✅ or 🔶 for G11 |
| ⑥ | Zero open post-mortems | Post-mortem log: zero entries with status=open |

## A.4 Current Implementation State (CC+GC, 2026-06-10)

> **Framework Score (v10)**: ~100% — all 66 items are defined with governance rules in §3.
> **Implementation Score (v10)**: ~36.3% — 4 new T0 top-level items (4-13, 4-14, 4-15, 5-12) temporarily reduce deployment score.
> New items in v10 at T0: 4-13, 4-14, 4-15, 5-12. Sub-items improve existing item coverage marginally.

| Cat | Name | Items | Weight | Impl. Score | Target | Δ |
|:---:|:-----|:-----:|:------:|:-----------:|:------:|:--:|
| 0 | Human Intent | 6 | 8% | 0.17 | 0.95 | +0.78 |
| 1 | Cognitive Continuity | 5 | 17% | 0.60 | 0.95 | +0.35 |
| 2 | Collaboration | 9 | 22% | 0.28 | 0.95 | +0.67 |
| 3 | System Integrity | 15 | 28% | 0.42 | 0.95 | +0.53 |

| 6 | Delivery | 5 | 5% | 0.24 | 0.95 | +0.71 |
| **Root** | | **67** | **100%** | **~0.363 (36.3%)** | **~0.95** | **+0.59** |

```
Root = 0.08×0.17 + 0.17×0.60 + 0.22×0.28 + 0.28×0.42 + 0.13×0.34 + 0.07×0.18 + 0.05×0.24
     = 0.014 + 0.102 + 0.062 + 0.118 + 0.044 + 0.013 + 0.012
     = 0.363 (36.3%)

Framework Score: 100% (all 67 items defined)
Note: Implementation Score decreases when new T0 items are added. A lower Implementation Score
alongside a 100% Framework Score indicates pending deployment tasks, not regression.

G48-G57 implementation    → Implementation Score ~42%
P0+P1 implementation      → ~54%
P0+P2 implementation      → ~68%
Full P0–P3 implementation → ~95%

|:-----------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|:------|
| Token limit (native units) | — | — | — | Per task |
| Token counting standard (e.g., BPE-cl100k) | — | — | — | Map to ref unit |
| Streaming output supported | — | — | — | Optional |
| Function / tool calling | — | — | — | Required |
| Structured JSON output | — | — | — | Required |
| Vision / multimodal | — | — | — | Optional |
| Confidence reporting method | — | — | — | Map to 0–100 |
| Native protocol | — | — | — | Adapt in 4-9-1 |
| Rate limit (requests/min) | — | — | — | Track in 5-6-6 |
| Depth semantics (collaboration_depth interpretation) | — | — | — | Document in 4-9-1 |
| Output schema format | — | — | — | Normalize in 4-9-2 |
| Model version pinning supported | — | — | — | Required |
| Cost (per 1M ref tokens in `budget_unit_standard`) | — | — | — | Track in 5-6-5 |

**Adapter checklist per vendor** (4-9-1 compliance, must satisfy 4-13 first):
- [ ] 4-13 Canonical Interface Contract satisfied: capability contract, error normalization, schema
- [ ] `native_protocol` declared
- [ ] `token_converter(vendor → ref_tokens)` implemented and tested
- [ ] `output_format_converter(native → canonical)` implemented and tested
- [ ] `confidence_mapping_fn(vendor → 0–100)` implemented and tested
- [ ] `depth_interpretation_schema(depth → vendor semantics)` documented
- [ ] Behavioral regression suite (4-8-2) passed with this adapter
- [ ] Wrapper code open-auditable and version-pinned (4-6-4)

**Extension/Tool checklist** (4-14 compliance):
- [ ] Registered in extension registry (4-14-2) with version pin
- [ ] Linked to 4-7 capability profile
- [ ] Execution scope declared (session-scoped or persistent)
- [ ] Authorization envelope from 2-3 Task Management in place
- [ ] Sandbox boundaries defined (4-14-1) for agent frameworks
- [ ] MCP server lifecycle (connect/execute/teardown) documented (4-14-3)
